I use GB2312 as the default encoding for my .cpp source file,
 the Chinese charaters display correctly in the source file,
 but when use "ctrl + F" to search Chinese charaters,
 the content in the search box does not display correctly
 (in my case the content displays as some rectangles )
 though the search result is correct.
